# WebSocketTester

- WebSocketTester is the tester where developers can test the websocket api they want for their next project. A client application which can connect to WSserver, can start subscribing to the channels by passing the appropraite JSON by writing in Input TextField, Similarly Unsubscribing to channels can be done. Main purpose for making the project was there are several websocketTester but yet i haven't found the tester which handles the incoming Gzip data, compressed data, Blob.
